<p>Hello!  I'm Thamidul Islam Tonmoy. I'm a Research Assistant in DSP Research Lab, BUET. My research interests lie in the areas of image and signal processing. I am particularly  interested in applying the knowledge of computer vision and deep learning in biomedical image and signal processing to develop biomedical imaging techniques for more robust computer aided diagnosis system.</p>


<h2>Education</h2>
<ul class="skill-list">
	<li>B.Sc.(EEE) - Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET), Dhaka, Bangladesh</li>
	<li>HSC - Notre Dame College, Dhaka, Bangladesh</li>
	<li>SSC - Motijheel Model High School & College, Dhaka, Bangladesh</li>
</ul>


<h2>Research Experience</h2>
<ol reversed>
        <li><p><b>Image Processing with Convolutional Neural Network</b> (on going)<br>
          In this research, we are trying to remove noise/artifacts introduced by adverse environmental condition during capturing image using convolutional neural network.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition</b><br>
          Worked on the winning model of IEEE VIP Cup 2017 to enhance the robustness of the detection system which uses state of the art neural networks to tackle the challenge.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Breast Cancer Classification from Histopathological Image</b><br>
          In this undergrad thesis research, we explored the power of deep neural networks in two different domains (image and DCT) to classify breast histopathological images.</p></li>
